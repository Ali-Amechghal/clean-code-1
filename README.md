## Foreword
In software, **80%** or more of what we do is quaintly called *"maintenance"*: the act of repair.

Good software practice requires such discipline: *focus, presence of mind, and thinking*

The 5S philosophy comprises these concepts (Total Productive Maintenance - 1951):
* **S**eiri (organization): Knowing where things are—using approaches such as suitable naming—is crucial
* **S**eiton (tidiness): There is an old American saying: *A place for everything, and everything in its place*. A piece of code should be where you expect to find it —— and, if not, you should re-factor to get it there.
* **S**eiso (cleaning): Remove unused things (comments, etc). Get rid of them
* **S**eiketsu (standardization): The group agrees about how to keep the workplace clean.
* **S**hutsuke (self-discipline): Follow the practices, frequently reflect on one’s work and be willing to change

You should name a variable using the same care with which you name a first-born child.

"The code is the design" and "Simple code" are their mantras.

We are honest about the state of our code because code is never perfect.

## Introduction

Learning to write clean code is *hard work*. It requires more than just the knowledge of principles and patterns. 

You must practice it yourself, and watch yourself fail.

This book will make you work, *and work hard*. What kind of work will you be doing?

You’ll be reading code—lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code and what’s wrong with it.

This book into three parts:
* First part: The first several chapters describe the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code.
* Second part: It consists of several case studies of ever-increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up some code—of transforming code that has some problems into code that has fewer problems.
* Third part: It is a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and smells gathered while creating the case studies.
